## User Experience (UX)
### User Stories

The initial step taken was to the establish the user stories identifying the needs and requirements for the site. These have further provided the foundation for the project allowing me to categorise the development and deployment using agile methodology.

Each user below contains the initial story along with acceptance criteria. These both would need be satisfied during development and testing for the user story to be deemed a success.

### Mind Map: Ideas

Following on from the user stories, a initial mind map(pen to paper) was created to capture functionality of the site. The purpose of this was to provide a high-level understanding of how the user stories could be implemented:

![Mindmap](readme-images/mind_map.jpeg)


### Wireframe Designs

The next step taken was to create wireframes (shown below) using Balsamiq. These wireframes illustrate the planned layouts and components to be used to satisfy the user stories.

![menu](readme-images/wireframes/2_menu.png)

![booking_updated](readme-images/wireframes/13_booking_update.png)

### UX View

Following on from the wireframe designs, final UX views of the site were created:

![home/index](readme-images/UX/1_ux_home.png)

![menu](readme-images/UX/2_ux_menu.png)

![aboutus](readme-images/UX/3_ux_aboutus.png)

![booking_not_logged_in](readme-images/UX/4_ux_booking_not_logged_in.png)

![login](readme-images/UX/5_ux_sign_in.png)

![register](readme-images/UX/6_ux_register.png)

![logout](readme-images/UX/7_ux_logout.png)

![booking_logged_in](readme-images/UX/8_ux_booking_logged_in.png)

![delete_booking](readme-images/UX/9_ux_delete_booking.png)

![update_booking](readme-images/UX/10_ux_update_booking.png)

[Back to Contents.](#table-of-contents)

Completion of the UX element provided a clear refined picture of the finished product. The definition of colours, classes, placements, and components provided all the necessary information to develop the site ensuring a positive user experience.  


### Pseudo - functions needed (Brainstorm)

On completion of the UX element, the next step take was to map out the functions needed for the booking system to perform as needed: 

![pseudo-functions](readme-images/pseudo_functions.jpeg)

### Process Map

The diagrams below map out the processes and paths taken based on the choices made and the validation outcome:

![create booking](readme-images/process-maps/process_map_create_booking.png)

![update booking](readme-images/process-maps/process_map_update_booking.png)

![delete booking](readme-images/process-maps/process_map_delete_booking.png)

![promotion management](readme-images/process-maps/process_map_prmotions.png)

![menu management](readme-images/process-maps/process_map_menu.png)

These process maps have played a pivital part as a reference guide during the course of the development. They have allowed me to ensure that all requirements and acceptance criteria from the user stories have been satisfied.

### Models and Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD's)

The project is broken down in to four django models:

1. WelcomePromotion - for the promotions on the home page.
2. MenuItem - for the menu items.
3. MakeBooking - for the bookings.
4. AboutUs - for the content on the about us page. 

#### 1. WelcomePromotion

The welcome model contains the setup:

- promotion_title:  the title for the promotion.
- description: description of the promotion.
- is_valid: whether the current promotion is running or not.
- added_on: automated date on when the promotion was added.

The ERD schema for the WelcomePromotion model is displayed below:

![ERD: WelcomePromotion](readme-images/ERDS/erd_welcomePromotion.png)


#### 2. MenuItem

The MenuItem model contains the setup:

- name: name of the item.
- description: description of the item.

#### 3. MakeBooking

The MakeBooking model contains the setup:

- user: name of the requested user.
- name: name for the booking(automatically assigned the requested user).

#### 4. AboutUs

The AboutUs model contains the setup:

- name: name of the entry.
- description: content for the current entry.
