### Mind Map: Ideas

Following on from the user stories, a initial mind map(pen to paper) was created to capture functionality of the site. The purpose of this was to provide a high-level understanding of how the user stories could be implemented:

### Wireframe Designs

The next step taken was to create wireframes (shown below) using Balsamiq. These wireframes illustrate the planned layouts and components to be used to satisfy the user stories.

### UX View

Following on from the wireframe designs, final UX views of the site were created:
