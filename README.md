### Mind Map: Ideas

Following on from the user stories, an initial mind map(pen to paper) was created to capture functionality of the site. The purpose of this was to provide a high-level understanding of how the user stories could be implemented:

![Mindmap](readme-images/mind_map.jpeg)

### Wireframe Designs

The next step taken was to create wireframes (shown below) using Balsamiq. These wireframes illustrate the planned layouts and components to be used to satisfy the user stories.

![home/index](readme-images/wireframes/1_home.png)

![menu](readme-images/wireframes/2_menu.png)

![aboutus](readme-images/wireframes/3_aboutus.png)

![booking_not_logged_in](readme-images/wireframes/4_booking_not_logged_in.png)

![login](readme-images/wireframes/5_login.png)

![register](readme-images/wireframes/6_Register.png)

![logout](readme-images/wireframes/7_logout.png)

![booking_logged_in](readme-images/wireframes/8_booking_logged_in.png)

![booking_created](readme-images/wireframes/9_booking_created.png)

![booking_unavailable](readme-images/wireframes/10_booking_unavailable.png)

![booking_invalid](readme-images/wireframes/11_booking_invalid.png)

![booking_deleted](readme-images/wireframes/12_booking_delete.png)

![booking_updated](readme-images/wireframes/13_booking_update.png)

[Back to Contents.](#table-of-contents)


### UX View

Following on from the wireframe designs, final UX views of the site were created:

![home/index](readme-images/UX/1_ux_home.png)

![menu](readme-images/UX/2_ux_menu.png)

![aboutus](readme-images/UX/3_ux_aboutus.png)

![booking_not_logged_in](readme-images/UX/4_ux_booking_not_logged_in.png)

![login](readme-images/UX/5_ux_sign_in.png)

![register](readme-images/UX/6_ux_register.png)

![logout](readme-images/UX/7_ux_logout.png)

![booking_logged_in](readme-images/UX/8_ux_booking_logged_in.png)

![delete_booking](readme-images/UX/9_ux_delete_booking.png)

![update_booking](readme-images/UX/10_ux_update_booking.png)

[Back to Contents.](#table-of-contents)

Completion of the UX element provided a clear refined picture of the finished product. The definition of colours, classes, placements, and components provided all the necessary information to develop the site ensuring a positive user experience.  


### Pseudo - functions needed (Brainstorm)

On completion of the UX element, the next step take was to map out the functions needed for the booking system to perform as needed: 

![pseudo-functions](readme-images/pseudo_functions.jpeg)

### Process Map

The diagrams below map out the processes and paths taken based on the choices made and the validation outcome:

![create booking](readme-images/process-maps/process_map_create_booking.png)

![update booking](readme-images/process-maps/process_map_update_booking.png)

![delete booking](readme-images/process-maps/process_map_delete_booking.png)

![promotion management](readme-images/process-maps/process_map_prmotions.png)

![menu management](readme-images/process-maps/process_map_menu.png)

These process maps have played an essential part as a reference guide during the development. They have allowed me to ensure that all requirements and acceptance criteria from the user stories have been satisfied. 

**Please note:** The process to add, update, or delete promotions and menu items is carried out via the admin panel. The purpose of the process maps for this functionality is to highlight suitability and how it aligns with the project goals.

### Models and Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD's)

The project is broken down into four models:

1. WelcomePromotion - for the promotions on the home page.
2. MenuItem - for the menu items.
3. MakeBooking - for the bookings.
4. AboutUs - for the content on the about us page. 

#### 1. WelcomePromotion

The welcome model contains the setup:

- promotion_title:  the title for the promotion.
- description: description of the promotion.
- is_valid: whether the current promotion is running or not.
- added_on: automated date on when the promotion was added.

The ERD schema for the WelcomePromotion model is displayed below:

![ERD: WelcomePromotion](readme-images/ERDS/erd_welcomePromotion.png)


#### 2. MenuItem

The MenuItem model contains the setup:

- name: name of the item.
- description: description of the item.
- category: category choices( Starter, Main, Side, Dessert, Drink).
- price: cost of the item.
- added_on: automated date on when the item was added to the menu.

The ERD schema for the MenuItem model is displayed below:

![ERD: MenuItem](readme-images/ERDS/erd_MenuItem.png)


#### 3. MakeBooking

The MakeBooking model contains the setup:

- user: the individual creating the booking. This is retrieved from the User model. 
- email: email for the booking.
- phone: phone for the booking.
- date: date of the booking.
- time_slot: time for the booking.
- number_of_people: number of people on the booking.

#### 4. AboutUs

The AboutUs model contains the setup:

- name: name of the entry.
- description: content for the current entry.
- added_on: automated date on when entry was added in.
- is_valid: whether the current about us content is displayed or not. 

The ERD schema for the AboutUs model is displayed below:

![ERD: AboutUs](readme-images/ERDS/erd_AboutUs.png)

**Please note:** fields containing the value null have the option to remain blank as they are optional.

## Project Walkthrough

### Roles

For the purposes of this project, roles with specific permissions have been setup and are as follows:

**manager:** The manager account has been setup so that they can:
- add/update/delete promotions on the home page.
- update content on the about us page.
- add/update/delete items on the menu.

**admin:** The admin account has been setup so that they can:
- add/update/delete promotions from the home page.

**testuser:** The testuser account is a customer regular at Sultan's, registered via the website and can:
- add/update/delete their own bookings.
- can only see their own bookings when logged in.

For clarity, these accounts will be referenced throughout this document.

**Please note:** The management of the menu, promotions and about us content is done using Django's admin panel. It is proposed as future developments to incorporate this into the front-end design reducing the need to use the admin panel.

## Home

The site presents a clean, elegant design with the aim of providing a welcoming atmosphere. The user is presented with a crisp layout, in an easy flowing colour scheme. The user's attention is captured by promotions available which are presented in an eye-catching way. The site is accessible on multiple devices giving a seamless user experience as illustrated below:

![Responsive site](readme-images/project-walkthrough/responsive-all-devices.png)

_**Image above generated using https://ui.dev/amiresponsive illustrating the responsiveness of the site.**_

### Features
#### Navigation

- The top of the page features a navigation menu with the site links available to the right.
- home, menu, book, about us, login, register links: these take the user to the respected pages. 
- The navigation menu is available through the site and is styled reflecting which page the user is currently on(in bold) and which link is being hovered over (in red).

![menu-bar-full](readme-images/project-walkthrough/menu_full.png)

#### Menu - toggle
 
 - Devices running in other views such as mobile are presented with a light version of the menu that can be expanded as need providing the same functionality as the full version:

 ![toggle-menu](readme-images/project-walkthrough/menu_toggle.png)

 If a staff user (manager or admin) logs in, the menu updates with an additional link to the admin panel is usefully made available:

 ![admin-link](readme-images/project-walkthrough/admin_link.png)


 Below the menu, the user is welcomed to the site and instantly made aware of any special promotions that are running at the restaurant:


![home-welcome](readme-images/project-walkthrough/home_welcome.png)

The homepage also provides additional user interaction by placing convenient links to the menu and the bookings page in a clear manner. The placement of these links highlights the ease of access to the services on offer:

![follow-on-links](readme-images/project-walkthrough/follow_on_links.png)

Should the admin add, update, or remove any current promotions via the admin panel, these changes are reflected instantly on the live home page:

![no-promotions](readme-images/project-walkthrough/no-promotions.png)


#### Footer

- The footer contains links to the respected social media sites Facebook, X, Instagram, and YouTube using font awesome icons.
- These links are all opened in a new tab.
- The footer is available on all pages.

![footer-links](readme-images/project-walkthrough/footer_links.png)

**Please note:** There are currently no active social media pages for Sultan's. These links have been added in as place holders only. 

[Back to Contents.](#table-of-contents)

## Menu
### Features

Navigating to the menu page the user is presented with simple but effective layout. The menu has been broken down into the relevant categories to provide maximum user experience:

![menu-page](readme-images/project-walkthrough/menu_page.png)

The user has the option to select any heading as they please resulting in a fully responsive, interactive menu that provides the requested information. The menu items are listed with their name, description (if applicable) and price:

![show-menu-open](readme-images/project-walkthrough/show_menu_open.png)

There is an allergen note made available at the bottom of the menu, ensuring that any necessary information is available to user along with any dietary information.

Like the promotions on the home page, if the manager adds, updates, or removes any items from the menu, these changes are reflected instantly. This ensures that that site always provides the latest version of the menu.

[Back to Contents.](#table-of-contents)

## Bookings
### Features

The booking page requires the user to be logged in. The purpose of this login is to ensure that only the logged in user can create, update, or delete a booking, which is reflected within their account. The initial navigation to this page presents the following:

![alt text](readme-images/project-walkthrough/booking_not_logged_in.png)

If the user already has an account with Sultan's, they are welcome to login. On successful login, they are re-directed to the bookings page under their account. 

If the user is a new visitor to the site and does not have an account, they have a link available on the login page and the navigation menu to register:

![register](readme-images/project-walkthrough/register.png)

The registration process is simple; a username, optional email and a password that meets the criteria given. Once registered, the user is logged in as this registered user and automatically logged in:

![logged-in](readme-images/project-walkthrough/booking_logged_in.png)

**Please Note:** The assumption is now that the testuser has logged in for the remainder of this section.

Once logged, the booking page features a form allowing testuser to create a booking. The information collected on the form is:

- Email - required field (in the correct format).
- Phone - required field (in the correct format with a maximum of 11 numbers).
- Date - required field ( from today onwards)
- Time slot - required field.
- Number of people - required field.
- special requests - optional.

![booking-form](readme-images/project-walkthrough/booking_form_empty.png)

On submission of the form, the required fields are validated. If there are any errors, these are highlighted accordingly, prompting correction.

In addition to the validation, there is a requirement for the date to be valid; it can only be from today onwards. Should the date be prior to today, an alert is given:

![invalid-date](readme-images/project-walkthrough/invalid_date.png)

[Back to Contents.](#table-of-contents)

### Create Booking

On a successful submission of the form, the site will perform an availability check to ensure that the date and time requested by testuser is available to book. If available, the booking will be created, testuser notified, and the booking details made available in testuser's account:

![booking-created](readme-images/project-walkthrough/booking_created.png)

If there is no availability, testuser is notified accordingly:

![no-availability](readme-images/project-walkthrough/no-availability.png)

The options to update and delete the booking are now available to testuser.

### Update Booking

To update the booking, the "Update" button is clicked which takes testuser to the update booking page. This page pre-populates the form with the current details make the process quick and easy:

![update-booking](readme-images/project-walkthrough/update_booking.png)

Testuser now can simply go in and update fields such as the number of people, or special requests, and save the form. If the date and time are to change, this would need to be checked for availability. If there is availability, the booking is updated, and an alert displayed:

![booking-updated](readme-images/project-walkthrough/booking_updated.png)

If there is no availability, like creating a booking, an alert is displayed. 

Should testuser want to navigate back to the bookings page, and select another booking, there is a "click here" link available to do this. 

[Back to Contents.](#table-of-contents) 

### Delete Booking

To delete the booking, the "Delete" button is selected which displays an alert asking for confirmation of the delete:

![delete-confirm](readme-images/project-walkthrough/delete-confirm.png)

Once the delete has been confirmed, the selected booking is deleted and no longer visible in testuser's account. An alert is also displayed confirming the delete:

![booking-deleted](readme-images/project-walkthrough/booking_deleted.png)

### Booking Management

The manager can manage all the bookings that have been created. Once logged in, and authenticated as having access to the admin panel the manager will have total visibility:

![manager-booking-visbility](readme-images/project-walkthrough/manager_booking_visibility.png)

From here, the manager can create, update, or delete bookings. Once the necessary action has been performed, the respected user account will show the changes.

In addition to this, to allow the management of bookings to be as efficient as possible, the manager has the facility to search by username, email, and phone. Filtering options are also available and include date and time slot which can be seen on the right of the screen.


## About us

The about us page highlights the core values of Sultan's in the clear, easy to ready format that is seen throughout the site:

![aboutus](readme-images/project-walkthrough/about_us.png)

The manager can update and style the content on the about us page as needed. This includes, colours, spacing and font size as examples. 

**Please Note:** The assumption is that there will only be one entry active at one time, managed at a local level. The site ensures that only the latest version of this entry is always displayed.

To complete the current logged in session, a logout option is available on the menu bar which prompts confirmation:

![logout](readme-images/project-walkthrough/logout.png)

Once confirmed, the testuser is logged out and the site is ready for the next user.

## Testing

### Fixed Bugs 

### Fixed Bugs 
* **Issue 1 (ID 2f88738):** Bookings were successfully being created but not attached to the user creating them. This meant that any logged in user was able to see all the bookings created.

  * **Fix (ID 7bebcc1):** This was fixed by adding a filter to the query fetching the current bookings. The filter only returned bookings where the user making the bookings was the same as the user currently logged in. This was tested with 2 individual test accounts to ensure it worked as it should be.

* **Issue 2 (ID 6ad7f00):**  The booking form "phone" field allowed for non-digit characters to pass through as valid. The same phone field was validated correctly within the admin panel using the regex in place.

* **Fix (ID 2c4527c):** This was fixed by adding a custom validation on the form field to raise an error if the entered data did not consist of all digits. The validation error displayed using the Django message network.

This was further refined (ID 13ea71e) with the installation of crispy forms. After testing, the validation was being returned correctly and displayed in line with the other form validation. This was tested further over the next few commits and the custom validation removed as it was no longer needed.

* **Issue 3 (ID 13ea71e):** 
**_Note_**: This bug was found after the commit.

If the fields other than the date and time were being updated, the booking was being noted as a duplicate and alerting the user as such. For example, if the booking required the addition of people with a special request of "surprise meal"  on the same date and time slot, the booking was not being updated.

* **Fix (ID c2e3c54):** This was fixed by refactoring the update booking function as follows:
1. Check if the form is valid.
2.  store the forms date and time slot.
3. if posted form date and time different from the current booking date and time slot:
    - check the availability as done previously.
    - save if available.
4. If the date and time remains unchanged, save the form with any other changes.

## Future Developments

There are three potential future developments for this project.

1. To incorporate the management of the promotions, menu and about us content so the CRUD actions can be carried out on the front-end reducing the need to navigate to the admin panel.

2. Allow tables to have multiple bookings.

3. Email notifications for when a booking is created, updated, or deleted.

## Workload Planning

## Site Production, Deployment and Contribution  

### Site production

The site was created using Gitpodâ€™s VS Code workspace environment with all the relevant files and folder structures and migrated to the desktop version of VSCode using the instructions provide by Code Institute [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTrL4s5fkIY_SJXjazXiAd6LDKjS7uZMHwY9XW6REJ2T_DyCGRRjjmW-0p4NnkomUwAAru0vLYALohw/pub)

To deploy to GitHub, the following steps were taken:

 **Important**: Ensure the `DEBUG` is set to `False` in the project settings **before** deploying!

The commands carried out to in the command line terminal to commit and push the changes to the GitHub repository:

1. `git add .`- (Staging the changes in the current working tree ready to be committed).

2.  `git commit -m 'Meaningful commit message"` - (The working tree is prepared with an upload message).

3.  `git push` - (changes are pushed out up to the GitHub repository).

### Deployment

The site was deployed using Heroku. The steps to deploy are as follows:

1. login to Heroku.
2. Select "create new app" .
3. Create app .
4. Select "Settings" tab at the top.
5. Scroll down to "Config Vars" and add the following keys and corresponding values:
    * `Key: DATABASE_URL`
    * `Key: SECRET_KEY`

**Note:** If you have any additional credentials, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.

7. Go to the "Deploy" tab at the top.
8. Select "GitHub" as the Deployment method.
9. Select "Connect to GitHub."
10. Search for your GitHub repository and click connect. Once connected, it will show as follows:

![github-heroku](readme-images/project-walkthrough/github_heroku.png)

11. Scroll down to "Manual deploy" and click "Deploy branch". The app will start to build installing the various packages listed and the dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file. Once complete, click on the "view" button which will take you to the live site.

There is also the option to "Enable Automatic Deploys" which will build the app as soon as it is pushed to the GitHub repository and can be used if preferred.

The live link to the site can be found here: [Sultans.](https://sultans-restaurant-eaffca2215ff.herokuapp.com/)

### Contribution

I welcome any contributions, recommendations or changes to the project. To do this, the GitHub repository would need to be forked from GitHub and downloaded locally so it can be worked on.

GitHub has provided step by step instructions on how to do this [here.](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project#forking-a-repository)
