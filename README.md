## User Experience (UX)
### User Stories

The first step taken was to establish the user stories identifying the needs and requirements for the site. These have further provided the foundation for the project allowing me to categorise the development and deployment using agile methodology.

Each user story below has the initial story along with acceptance criteria. These both would need be satisfied during development, testing and deployment for the user story to be considered a success.

### Mind Map: Ideas

Following on from the user stories, an initial mind map (pen to paper) was created to capture functionality of the site. The purpose of this was to provide a high-level understanding of how the user stories could be implemented:

![Mindmap](readme-images/mind_map.jpeg)

### Wireframe Designs

The next step taken was to create wireframes (shown below) using Balsamiq. These wireframes illustrate the planned layouts and components to be used to satisfy the user stories.

![home/index](readme-images/wireframes/1_home.png)

![menu](readme-images/wireframes/2_menu.png)

![aboutus](readme-images/wireframes/3_aboutus.png)

![booking_not_logged_in](readme-images/wireframes/4_booking_not_logged_in.png)

![login](readme-images/wireframes/5_login.png)

![register](readme-images/wireframes/6_Register.png)

![logout](readme-images/wireframes/7_logout.png)

![booking_logged_in](readme-images/wireframes/8_booking_logged_in.png)

![booking_created](readme-images/wireframes/9_booking_created.png)

![booking_unavailable](readme-images/wireframes/10_booking_unavailable.png)

![booking_invalid](readme-images/wireframes/11_booking_invalid.png)

![booking_deleted](readme-images/wireframes/12_booking_delete.png)

![booking_updated](readme-images/wireframes/13_booking_update.png)

[Back to Contents.](#table-of-contents)


### UX View

Following on from the wireframe designs, final UX views of the site were created:

![home/index](readme-images/UX/1_ux_home.png)

![menu](readme-images/UX/2_ux_menu.png)

![aboutus](readme-images/UX/3_ux_aboutus.png)

![booking_not_logged_in](readme-images/UX/4_ux_booking_not_logged_in.png)

![login](readme-images/UX/5_ux_sign_in.png)

![register](readme-images/UX/6_ux_register.png)

![logout](readme-images/UX/7_ux_logout.png)

![booking_logged_in](readme-images/UX/8_ux_booking_logged_in.png)

![delete_booking](readme-images/UX/9_ux_delete_booking.png)

![update_booking](readme-images/UX/10_ux_update_booking.png)

[Back to Contents.](#table-of-contents)

Completion of the UX element provided a clear refined picture of the finished product. The definition of colours, classes, placements, and components provided all the necessary information to develop the site ensuring a positive user experience.  


### Pseudo - functions needed (Brainstorm)

On completion of the UX element, the next step take was to map out the functions needed for the booking system to perform as needed: 

![pseudo-functions](readme-images/pseudo_functions.jpeg)

### Process Map

The diagrams below map out the processes and paths taken based on the choices made and the validation outcome:

![create booking](readme-images/process-maps/process_map_create_booking.png)

![update booking](readme-images/process-maps/process_map_update_booking.png)

![delete booking](readme-images/process-maps/process_map_delete_booking.png)

![promotion management](readme-images/process-maps/process_map_prmotions.png)

![menu management](readme-images/process-maps/process_map_menu.png)

These process maps have played an essential part as a reference guide during the development. They have allowed me to ensure that all requirements and acceptance criteria from the user stories have been satisfied. 

**Please note:** The process to add, update, or delete promotions and menu items is carried out via the admin panel. The purpose of the process maps for this functionality is to highlight suitability and how it aligns with the project goals.

### Models and Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD's)

The project is broken down into four models:

1. WelcomePromotion - for the promotions on the home page.
2. MenuItem - for the menu items.
3. MakeBooking - for the bookings.
4. AboutUs - for the content on the about us page. 

#### 1. WelcomePromotion

The welcome model has the following setup:

- promotion_title:  the title for the promotion.
- description: description of the promotion.
- is_valid: whether the current promotion is running or not.
- added_on: automated date on when the promotion was added.

The ERD schema for the WelcomePromotion model is displayed below:

![ERD: WelcomePromotion](readme-images/ERDS/erd_welcomePromotion.png)


#### 2. MenuItem

The MenuItem model has the following setup:

- name: name of the item.
- description: description of the item.
- category: category choices( Starter, Main, Side, Dessert, Drink).
- price: cost of the item.
- added_on: automated date on when the item was added to the menu. 
- active: whether the item is available or not.

The ERD schema for the MenuItem model is displayed below:

![ERD: MenuItem](readme-images/ERDS/erd_MenuItem.png)


#### 3. MakeBooking

The MakeBooking model has the following setup:

- user: the individual creating the booking. This is retrieved from the User model. 
- email: email for the booking.
- phone: phone for the booking.
- date: date of the booking.
- time_slot: time for the booking.
- number_of_people: number of people on the booking.
- special_requests: any special requests for the booking (e.g. birthday).

The ERD schema for the MakeBooking model is displayed below:

![ERD: MakeBooking](readme-images/ERDS/erd_MakeBooking.png)

#### 4. AboutUs

The AboutUs model has the following setup:

- title: name of the entry.
- description: content for the current entry.
- added_on: automated date on when entry was added in.
- is_valid: whether the current about us content is displayed or not. 

The ERD schema for the AboutUs model is displayed below:

![ERD: AboutUs](readme-images/ERDS/erd_AboutUs.png)

**Please note:** nullable fields above are optional fields.

## Project Walkthrough

### Roles

For the purposes of this project, roles with specific permissions have been setup and are as follows:

**manager:** The manager account has been setup so that they can:
- add/update/delete promotions on the home page.
- update content on the about us page.
- add/update/delete items on the menu.

**admin:** The admin account has been setup so that they can:
- add/update/delete promotions from the home page.

**testuser:** The testuser account is a regular customer at Sultan's, registered via the website and can:
- add/update/delete their own bookings.
- can only see their own bookings when logged in.

For clarity, these accounts will be referenced throughout this document.

**Please note:** The management of the menu, promotions and about us content is done using Django's admin panel. It is proposed as future developments to incorporate this into the front-end design reducing the need to use the admin panel.

## Home

The site presents a clean, elegant design with the aim of providing a welcoming atmosphere. The user is presented with a crisp layout, in an easy flowing colour scheme. The user's attention is captured by promotions available which are presented in an eye-catching way. The site is accessible on multiple devices giving a seamless user experience as illustrated below:

![Responsive site](readme-images/project-walkthrough/responsive-all-devices.png)

_**Image above generated using https://ui.dev/amiresponsive illustrating the responsiveness of the site.**_

### Features
#### Navigation

- The top of the page features a navigation menu with the site links available to the right.
- home, menu, book, about us, login, register links: these take the user to the respected pages. 
- The navigation menu is available through the site and is styled reflecting which page the user is currently on(in bold) and which link is being hovered over (in red).

![menu-bar-full](readme-images/project-walkthrough/menu_full.png)

#### Menu - toggle
 
 - Devices running in other views such as mobile are presented with a light version of the menu that can be expanded  providing the same functionality as the full version:

 ![toggle-menu](readme-images/project-walkthrough/menu_toggle.png)

 If a staff user (manager or admin) logs in, the menu updates with an added link to the admin panel usefully made available:

 ![admin-link](readme-images/project-walkthrough/admin_link.png)


 Below the menu, the user is welcomed to the site and instantly made aware of any special promotions that are running at the restaurant:


![home-welcome](readme-images/project-walkthrough/home_welcome.png)

The homepage also provides further user interaction by placing convenient links to the menu and the bookings page in a clear manner. The placement of these links highlights the ease of access to the services on offer:

![follow-on-links](readme-images/project-walkthrough/follow_on_links.png)

Should the **admin** add, update, or remove any current promotions via the admin panel, these changes are reflected instantly on the live home page:

![no-promotions](readme-images/project-walkthrough/no-promotions.png)


#### Footer

- The footer contains links to the respected social media sites Facebook, X, Instagram, and YouTube using font awesome icons.
- These links are all opened in a new tab.
- The footer is available on all pages.

![footer-links](readme-images/project-walkthrough/footer_links.png)

**Please note:** There are currently no active social media pages for Sultan's. These links have been added in as place holders only. 

[Back to Contents.](#table-of-contents)

## Menu
### Features

Navigating to the menu page the user is presented with simple but effective layout. The menu has been broken down into the relevant categories to provide maximum user experience:

![menu-page](readme-images/project-walkthrough/menu_page.png)

The user has the option to select any heading as they please resulting in a fully responsive, interactive menu that provides the requested information. The menu items are listed with their name, description (if applicable) and price:

![show-menu-open](readme-images/project-walkthrough/show_menu_open.png)

There is an allergen note made available at the bottom of the menu, ensuring that any necessary information is available along with any dietary information.

Like the promotions on the home page, if the **manager** adds, updates, or removes any items from the menu, these changes are reflected instantly. This ensures that the site always provides the latest version of the menu.

[Back to Contents.](#table-of-contents)

## Booking
### Features

The booking page requires the user to be logged in. The purpose of this login is to ensure that only the logged in user can create, update, or delete a booking, which is reflected within their account. The initial navigation to this page presents the following:

![alt text](readme-images/project-walkthrough/booking_not_logged_in.png)

If the user already has an account with Sultan's, they are welcome to login. On successful login, they are re-directed to the bookings page under their account. 

If the user is a new visitor to the site and does not have an account, they have a link available on the login page and the navigation menu to register:

![register](readme-images/project-walkthrough/register.png)

The registration process is simple; a username, optional email and a password that meets the criteria given. Once registered, the user is automatically logged in:

![logged-in](readme-images/project-walkthrough/booking_logged_in.png)

**Please Note:** The assumption is now that the **testuser** has logged in for the rest of this section.

Once logged, the booking page features a form allowing **testuser** to create a booking. The information collected on the form is:

- Email - required field (in the correct format).
- Phone - required field (in the correct format with a maximum of 11 numbers).
- Date - required field ( from today onwards)
- Time slot - required field.
- Number of people - required field.
- special requests - optional.

![booking-form](readme-images/project-walkthrough/booking_form_empty.png)

On submission of the form, the required fields are validated. If there are any errors, these are highlighted accordingly, prompting correction.

In addition to the validation, there is a requirement for the date to be valid; it can only be from today onwards. Should the date be prior to today, an alert is given:

![invalid-date](readme-images/project-walkthrough/invalid_date.png)

[Back to Contents.](#table-of-contents)

### Create Booking

On a successful submission of the form, the site will perform an availability check to ensure that the date and time requested by **testuser** is available to book. If available, the booking will be created, **testuser** notified, and the booking details made available in **testuser's** account:

![booking-created](readme-images/project-walkthrough/booking_created.png)

If there is no availability, **testuser** is notified accordingly:

![no-availability](readme-images/project-walkthrough/no-availability.png)

The options to update and delete the booking are now available to **testuser.**

### Update Booking

To update the booking, the "Update" button is clicked which takes **testuser** to the update booking page. This page pre-populates the form with the current details making the process quick and easy:

![update-booking](readme-images/project-walkthrough/update_booking.png)

**Testuser** now can simply go in and update fields such as the number of people, or special requests, and save the form. If the date and time are to change, this would need to be checked for availability. If there is availability, the booking is updated, and an alert displayed:

![booking-updated](readme-images/project-walkthrough/booking_updated.png)

If there is no availability, like creating a booking, an alert is displayed. 

Should **testuser** want to navigate back to the bookings page, and select another booking, there is a "click here" link available to do this. 

[Back to Contents.](#table-of-contents) 

### Delete Booking

To delete the booking, the "Delete" button is selected which displays an alert asking for confirmation of the delete:

![delete-confirm](readme-images/project-walkthrough/delete-confirm.png)

Once the delete has been confirmed, the selected booking is deleted and no longer visible in **testuser's** account. An alert is also displayed confirming the delete:

![booking-deleted](readme-images/project-walkthrough/booking_deleted.png)

### Booking Management

The **manager** can manage all the bookings that have been created. Once logged in, and authenticated as having access to the admin panel, the **manager** will have total visibility:

![manager-booking-visbility](readme-images/project-walkthrough/manager_booking_visibility.png)

From here, the **manager** can create, update, or delete bookings. Once the necessary action has been performed, the respected user account will show the changes.

In addition to this, to allow the management of bookings to be as efficient as possible, the **manager** has the facility to search by username, email, and phone. Filtering options are also available and include date and time slot which can be seen on the right of the screen.

[Back to Contents.](#table-of-contents)

## About us

The about us page highlights the core values of Sultan's in a clear, easy to ready format that is seen throughout the site:

![aboutus](readme-images/project-walkthrough/about_us.png)

The **manager** can update and style the content on the about us page as needed. This includes, colours, spacing and font size as examples. 

**Please Note:** The assumption is that there will only be one entry active at one time, managed at a local level. The site ensures that only the latest version of this entry is always displayed.

To complete the current logged in session, a logout option is available on the menu bar which prompts confirmation:

![logout](readme-images/project-walkthrough/logout.png)

Once confirmed, the **testuser** is logged out and the site is ready for the next user.

[Back to Contents.](#table-of-contents) 

## Testing

### Fixed Bugs 

### Issue 1 (ID 2f88738)
Bookings were successfully being created but not attached to the user creating them. This meant that any logged in user was able to see all the bookings created.

### - Fix (ID 7bebcc1) 
This was fixed by adding a filter to the query fetching the current bookings. The filter only returned bookings where the user on the bookings was the same as the user currently logged in. This was tested with two individual test accounts to ensure it worked as it should be.

---

### Issue 2 (ID 6ad7f00)
The booking form `phone` field allowed for non-digit characters to pass through as valid. The same `phone` field was validated correctly within the admin panel using the regex in place.

### - Fix (ID 2c4527c) 
This was fixed by adding a custom validation on the form `phone` field to raise an error if the entered data didn't contain all digits. The validation error is displayed using the Django message network.

This was further refined **(ID 13ea71e)** with the installation of crispy forms. After testing, the validation was being returned correctly and displayed in line with the other form validation. This was tested further over the next few commits and the custom validation removed as it was no longer needed.

---

### Issue 3 (ID 13ea71e)
**_Note_**: This bug was found after the commit.

If the fields other than the date and time were being updated, the booking was noted as a duplicate and alerting the user as such. For example, if the booking required the addition of people with a special request of "surprise meal"  on the same date and time slot, the booking was not being updated.

### - Fix (ID c2e3c54) 
This was fixed by refactoring the update booking function introducing a booking changed check:
1. Check if the form is valid.
2.  store the forms date and time slot.
3. if posted form date and time different from the current booking date and time slot:
    - check the availability as done previously.
    - save if available.
4. If the date and time remains unchanged, save the form with any other changes. 

---

### Issue 4 (ID 75c9f56) 
**_Note_**: This bug was found after the commit.

On certain resolutions the background on the menu page was scaling when the menu was expanded and returning to its normal size once closed.

### - Fix (ID a15c09a) 
This was fixed by applying the `background-attachment: fixed` to menu background in CSS. It was tested locally and once deployed with no further issues seen.

---

### Issue 5 (ID 75c9f56) 
 **_Note_**: This bug was found after the commit.

Any logged in user can edit/delete another user's bookings directly via URL access without authentication or authorisation.

  - Reproduced by:
    - Logging in as User A
    - Creating a valid booking - booking confirmed.
    - Logging in as User B and navigating to:
    - https://sultans-restaurant-eaffca2215ff.herokuapp.com/book/update_booking/199/ - the 199 would change to the number of the booking created by User A

  - On navigating to the above, User B is able to see User A's booking information.
  - Possible sensitive information can be viewed, updated or deleted without the original author's knowledge.

  - **Please note:** This issue affects the deletion of bookings in the same way. The URL section `update_booking` would change to `delete_booking`, the remainder of URL would remain the same.

### - Fix(ID 0ef9b09)

This was was fixed by adding in the follow additional access control checks within `book views.py`. 
  
Within the `update_booking` function, a check is done to see if the logged in user is the same as the user who created the booking or is an admin. If so, the user and admin are able to update the selected booking. If not, a forbidden notification is shown to the user and a redirection to the booking page takes place.

Within the `delete_booking` function, if the logged in user is the same as the one who created the booking, they are able to delete their own booking. If an admin tries to delete, they are prompted to do this via the admin panel. If the user is not the same as the one who created the booking, a forbidden notification is shown to the user and a redirection to the booking page takes place.

---

**Please Note**: As far as I am aware, there are no remaining bugs. I have endeavoured to throughly test the site but am unable to completely rule out the possibility of any arising in the future.

### Code Validation

#### HTML

The code has been tested using the official [W3C HTML Validator.](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fsultans-restaurant-eaffca2215ff.herokuapp.com%2F) This has been used to validate all of my HTML files and the results are tabulated below:

### Defensive Design Testing

In addition to the extensive testing carried out in this document, defensive design testing has been conducted. This testing is to ensure that the site processes and responds accordingly should any of the data or actions get manipulated to execute in any other way than originally designed.

The purpose of this testing is to also ensure that any user data is safe, and can only be accessed/modified by the user themselves or an admin. 

I have documented the expected action, the test carried out, the result, and provided a screenshot where applicable to demonstrate the defence in place. The results of this testing is tabulated below:

|Test | Expected Action                                                                    | Testing Steps                                                                                                                    | Results                                | Screenshot                                                          |

**Notes:**

*The `int` value used in DF3, DF4 and DF5 will be unique for each booking. This would need to match the booking created to replicated the relevant testing steps.

*DF3 and DF4*: This defence will only run if the booking user is not the same as the user accessing to see, update or delete the booking. Should both be the same, the action would be permitted as tested and documented in the Manual testing section above.
 - The admin is able to see and update any booking within the site using this update step. 
 
 The screenshot below confirms that this defence is working correctly:

 [![defence-usera-userb](readme-images/testing/defensive/df-usera-userb.png)]

 User A and User B have bookings attached to them respectively. Neither is able to navigate via URL to either see, update or delete the others bookings. If an attempt is made to access via URL, the user is informed and re-directed back to the booking page.

*DF5*: The logic for this additional measure has been influenced by multiple factors:
- As the admin is able to see all of the bookings within the site, deleting a booking via URL with the wrong booking `int` would mean the wrong booking being deleted without any details present to confirm if it was the correct one.
- In a busy restaurant, it is possible that the wrong booking `int` could be entered in error. This again, would mean the wrong booking being deleted in error.
- The admin may recieve the incorrect booking `int` from the user; the admin would have no way to confirm if the booking being deleted was in fact the one intended to be deleted.
- Deleting the booking via the admin panel would allow the admin to search/filter for the booking to be deleted, confirm the details, request to delete, and after a confirmation, the booking would be deleted and removed from the user's account.

## Future Developments

There are four potential future developments for this project.

1. To incorporate the management of the promotions, menu and about us content so the CRUD actions can be carried out on the front-end reducing the need to navigate to the admin panel.

2. Allow tables to have multiple bookings.

3. Email notifications for when a booking is created, updated, or deleted.

4. To incorporate all CRUD actions for the admin to manage the bookings via the front end removing the need to do this via the admin panel.

## Workload Planning

To manage the project, a live kanban board was used. Using this agile tool has allowed me to efficiently break down and manage the project. It has also facilitated the visualisation of the work involved, allowing the work to progress at a steady pace, and prioritise the completion of tasks before starting new ones.

The live completed board can be viewed [here.](https://github.com/users/NaveedNaseem84/projects/10)
 

## Site Production, Deployment and Contribution  

### Site Production

The site was initially created using Gitpodâ€™s VS Code workspace environment with all the relevant files and folder structures and migrated to the desktop version of VSCode using the instructions provide by Code Institute [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTrL4s5fkIY_SJXjazXiAd6LDKjS7uZMHwY9XW6REJ2T_DyCGRRjjmW-0p4NnkomUwAAru0vLYALohw/pub)


GitHub has been used for version control throughout the course of the project. The commands carried out in the command line terminal to commit and push the changes to the GitHub repository:

1. `git add .`- (Staging the changes in the current working tree ready to be committed).

2.  `git commit -m 'Meaningful commit message"` - (The working tree is prepared with an upload message).

3.  `git push` - (changes are pushed out up to the GitHub repository).

**Please note**: Ensure that the project `debug` is set to `False` before deploying. Deploying with this set to `True` in production can pose security risks.

### Localised development

To work on the project locally, it would need to be cloned or forked.

To clone:

1. Go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/NaveedNaseem84/PP4-Sultans-Restaurant).
2. Locate and click on the green "Code" button at the very top, above the commits and files near the "About" section.
3. Select whether you prefer to clone using "HTTPS", "SSH", or "GitHub CLI", and click the "copy" button to copy the URL to your clipboard.
4. Within your IDE Terminal either open the location of where you want to clone the project or change the currently working directly via the terminal.
5. In the terminal, type the following:
  
   `git clone https://github.com/NaveedNaseem84/PP4-Sultans-Restaurant.git`
6. Press enter. Within the terminal, the progress will be shown, and once completed, the project files can be seen in the project explorer.

**Please note**: Some IDE's such as VSCode provide the option to clone a repository by following the prompts given. Following this will provide the same result.

To Fork:

By forking the GitHub Repository, you make a copy of the original repository on your GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original owner's repository. You can fork this repository by using the following steps:

1. Login to GitHub and locate the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/NaveedNaseem84/PP4-Sultans-Restaurant).
2. At the top of the Repository, just below the "Settings" button on the menu, locate and click the "Fork" Button.
3. Once clicked, you should now have a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account.

The official GitHub documentation on how to do this is also available [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project#forking-a-repository). 

Once the repository has been cloned or forked and fetched within your IDE, a `env.py` file needs to be created at root level. Within this `env.py` file, the following needs to be added in:

```
import os

os.environ.setdefault(
    "DATABASE_URL",
    "YOUR-DB-URL")

os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "YOUR-SECRET-KEY")
```
For deployment, the keys above and their corresponding values need to be added into into the Heroku **config vars** in the exact same format.

The next step is to install all the packages required for the project to run and deploy. These are included in the `requirements.txt` file located in the root and can be installed using the terminal with the command 

`pip3 install -r requirements`

**Please note**: It can take a few minutes for the packages to be install and the progress can be seen in the terminal.

Once this has been completed, the project can be started up using `python3 manage.py runserver`. Press `CTRL + C` before the next step to stop the server.

To setup the database (locally or hosted), run the following commands within the terminal:

`python3 manage.py makemigrations --dry-run`

`python3 manage.py makemigrations`

then:

`python3 manage.py migrate --plan`

`python3 manage.py migrate`

Once the migration is complete, a superuser account needs to be created using:

`python3 manage.py createsuperuser`

**please note**: This superuser is required to access the admin panel, create additional users, manage promotions, menu items and about us content.

Once everything has installed and migrated successfully, the app can now be ran using `python3 manage.py runserver`. Please watch out for instructions in the terminal as it will inform you on how to open the webpage.

#### Static Files
The files located within the root static folder are collected and deployed to Heroku using a package called `White Noise`. This is already included as part of the `requirements.txt` file. However, if there are changes to any of the files (images, JavaScript, CSS etc) these changes would need to be "collected" before deployment. This can be done using:

`python manage.py collectstatic`

There is currently a `Procfile` present within the root of the project repository with the following:

`web: gunicorn sultans.wsgi`

**Please note**: References of sultans would need to replaced by the name of project being deployed as this is a vital requirement for the deployment phase.


### Deployment

#### Database: PostgreSQL

If you wish to work with a live database, an instance of PostgreSQL would need to be obtained.

For the purposes of this project, I have been fortunate enough to have access to databases instances as a Code Institute student. The databases contain a retention period of 18 months with each student allowed a maximum of 8 databases.

I took the following steps to obtain my own PostgreSQL database from Code Institute for this project:

- Navigating to and entering my Code Institute student email address in the requested [form.](https://dbs.ci-dbs.net/)
- An email was received shortly after containing the URL link to the database.
- This URL was then added into the `env.py` file within the project as shown above and Heroku config vars described below.

#### Heroku

The site was deployed using [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). The steps to deploy are as follows:

1. login to Heroku.
2. Select "create new app" and choose a suitable name for it.
3. Create app .
4. Select "Settings" tab at the top.
5. Scroll down to "Config Vars" and add the following keys and corresponding values:
    * `Key: DATABASE_URL`
    * `Key: SECRET_KEY`

**Note:** If you have any additional **config vars** to add they would need to be added to Heroku and the `env.py` within the project as demonstrated above.

7. Go to the "Deploy" tab at the top.
8. Select "GitHub" as the Deployment method.
9. Select "Connect to GitHub."
10. Search for your GitHub repository and click connect. Once connected, it will show as follows:

![github-heroku](readme-images/project-walkthrough/github_heroku.png)

11. Scroll down to "Manual deploy" and click "Deploy branch". The app will start to build installing the various packages listed and the dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file. Once complete, click on the "view" button which will take you to the live site.

There is also the option to "Enable Automatic Deploys" which will build the app as soon as it is pushed to the GitHub repository and can be used if preferred.

The live link to the site can be found here: [Sultans.](https://sultans-restaurant-eaffca2215ff.herokuapp.com/)

### Contribution

I welcome any contributions, recommendations or changes to the project. To do this, the GitHub repository would need to be cloned/forked from GitHub and downloaded locally so it can be worked on. Instructions on how to do this have been provided above.

### Content

* The general setup and structure for the project was completed following the guidance provided in the [I think Therefore I Blog - CI Project.](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+FSD101_WTS+6/courseware/713441aba05441dfb3a7cf04f3268b3f/824fccecd0fe4e44871eeabcbf69d830/)

* [Mardown Builder](https://markdown.2bn.dev/) was used a general reference guide for the production of this `README.md`
  - This includes core steps to clone and fork from github and deployment to Heroku detailed in the Site Production, Deployment and Contribution section.

* The core Bootstrap navbar in the `base.html` template was implemented using the [Bootstrap documentation on Navbar](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/navbar/)  and customised to my project requirements.

* Within the header -> nav section on the `base.html` template, the implementation of the nav-link if statement to determine if the current page is active or not was taken from [I Think Therefore I Blog > Templates -> Variable and control structures - CI Project.](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+FSD101_WTS+6/courseware/713441aba05441dfb3a7cf04f3268b3f/6b4a4f493cbd46ecb6f6a841c98f0c82/?child=first)

    ```<a class="nav-link
        {% if request.path == home_url %}active{%endif%}" aria-current="page" href="{% url 'home' %}">
    ```
  * The code above was refined further for accessibility and the correct classes applied to the Django messages by following the video [I Think Therefore I Blog > Where to put things > Tidying up - CI Project.](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+FSD101_WTS+6/courseware/713441aba05441dfb3a7cf04f3268b3f/0b5c6f09dcfd40fa99a9d68622d62b40/)

* Implementation and setup (including adding links to the nav-bar and authentication messages displayed in the `base.html` template) of the Django Allauth authentication was done using [I think before I Blog > Authentication > Introduction to authentication - CI Project.](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+FSD101_WTS+6/courseware/713441aba05441dfb3a7cf04f3268b3f/f614040ed41a49dbb268f0102af9ce05/)
  * The standard register, login, logout allauth templates were customised to match the needs of the project.

* The Django messages in the `base.html` template were displayed by adapting the code from  [I Think Therefore I Blog > Views Part 3>POSTing and writing to the database - CI Project.](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+FSD101_WTS+6/courseware/713441aba05441dfb3a7cf04f3268b3f/21a16093c0084895a6073422447c3f7d/?child=first)

  * The code utilised:
  ```
  ....
  {% for message in messages %}
      <div class="alert {{ message.tags }} alert-dismissible
        fade show" id="msg" role="alert">
        {{ message | safe }}
        <button type="button" class="btn-close"
          data-bs-dismiss="alert" aria-label="Close"></button>
      </div>
      {% endfor %}
  ....
  ```
  * This was further refined in line with the project.

* The core Bootstrap modal was implemented using the [Bootstrap documentation on Modal.](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/modal/)
 
* The structure to update/delete bookings (JavaScript and Python) was taken from [I Think Before I Blog > Views Part 3 > Editing and deleting records - CI Project.](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+FSD101_WTS+6/courseware/713441aba05441dfb3a7cf04f3268b3f/21a16093c0084895a6073422447c3f7d/?child=first)

  ```
  from django.contrib.messages import get_messages
  ....
  messages = [m.message for m in get_messages(response.wsgi_request)]
  self.assertIn('My message', messages)
  ```
  * Accessing the messages ensured the unit testing results were correct.

* The placement of a custom 404 page was done by following [Customizing Django 404 and 500 Error Pages - LearnDjango](https://learndjango.com/tutorials/customizing-django-404-and-500-error-pages)

I also would like to give a special thanks to the Tutor Assistance team at Code Institute for all their help on getting back on track during the migration period.


## Personal Summary

This project initially brought the steepest learning curve on my Code Institute coding journey. The whole new world of models, views and templates seemed to bring with it a whole new level of confusion! Taking the time to go over the detailed content material available repeatedly in small iterations has resulted in the project that can be seen here. A massive thank you to my legend of a mentor who not only gave invaluable advice but allowed me to push myself further to refine my work, and as an individual.

Returning to work on this project after completing a more complex e-commerce project allowed me to approach with a more refined knowledge base and skillset, which allowed me to refactor and refine a few aspects; the thought process naturally developed on how things could be done differently if the project was to be done again. 

The main take away point from this project has been around the value of using agile methodology and tools to manage the project through to completion. This was implemented in my final e-commerce project at Code Institute using prioritisation and using the project board as a go to for everything, listing everything allowing me to focus on the task at hand.
