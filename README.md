## Main page

### Features

The main page presents the player (user) with a python console in which the game is ran. The player is welcomed and invited to select a difficulty level:

![welcome - select difficulty](readme-images/welcome-screen.png)

**Please note:** For the purposes of this project, the following values have been used to determine the difficulty:

1 = easy (12 attempts)

2 = medium (8 attempts)

3 = hard (4 attempts)

If an invalid input is received, the player is notified of this and prompted to try again:

![Invalid input](readme-images/invalid-input.png)

Once a valid input has been received, the game begins. The player is presented with a randomly selected word, a letter count, and a hint to guess the word. In addition to this, the player is also made aware of the number of attempts available to guess the word:

![new game](readme-images/new-game.png)

The player also has the option to view rules on demand at any point of the game by typing "help":

![help](readme-images/help.png)

There is also the option to quit which terminates the game:

![quit](readme-images/quit.png)

**Please note:** on quitting, the "Run Program" button would need to be clicked to restart the game again.

If the input matches a letter within the word, the player is notified, and the word is updated to show all instances of this matched letter:

![input-matched](readme-images/input-matched.png)

Should the input not match a letter within the word, an attempt is used up. The incorrect inputs are recorded and displayed back to the player in a convenient way along with the updated attempts left:

![input-not-matched](readme-images/not-matched.png)

Once a word has been completely guessed, the player is congratulated on their win along with a summary of the game:

![won](readme-images/won.png)

If the attempts are all used up, the game is deemed over. The player is commiserated and again a summary of the game given:

![loss](readme-images/lost.png)

Irrespective of a winning or losing, the player has the option to carry on playing, resetting, or quitting.

The option to carry on playing will load a new game with a running total of the games won or lost incremented respectively:

![play again](readme-images/play-again.png)

The option to reset will restart the game and the running totals for games won or lost reset. The player is advised of the reset and presented the initial difficulty menu:

![game reset](readme-images/reset.png)

The option to quit will terminate the program as documented above.

These inputs are also validated, the player is notified if there is an input error:

![Invalid input on game complete](readme-images/game-complete-invalid.png)

[Back to Contents.](#table-of-contents)

## Testing

### Fixed Bugs 
* **Issue 1 (ID 7ae0beb):** The player was able to input upper- and lower-case letters. This in turn meant that an upper-case letter was different from a lower-case letter therefore being classed as an incorrect guess. For example, 'T' would not be the same as 't'.

    * **Fix (ID 23b2c0f):** This was fixed by formatting the input received and the random word selected using the .lower() built in function. Once implemented, a re-test found no further issues. 

* **Issue 2 (ID 5bf8a81):** The totals for the games won or lost were not incrementing when the continue playing option was selected.

    * **Fix (ID 276bc43):** This was fixed by globalising the variables won and lost. Once implemented, a re-test found no further issues. 

### Validation Testing

The code has been tested with the following:

* Python
   * No errors returned when running the code on the [Code Institute Python Linter.](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/)
   
   * The following results were returned:

      ![Linter results](readme-images/linter-results.png)

### Manual Testing

The following manual testing was carried out to confirm if the game performed as required and results matched the expected output.

### API Testing

The API has been evaluated to ensure that the game works correctly when there is data in the google sheet in the format `word: hint` as shown below:

![Google sheets format](readme-images/google-sheets-format.png)

Should there be no data present, the game will successfully pick this up and exit:

![Google sheets error](readme-images/google-sheets-error.png)

## Future Developments

There are three potential future developments for this project.

1. Expand the difficulty level - generate the complexity of the word/clue based on the difficulty selected.
2. A scores table showing the top wins with the least attempts used.
3. Retrieval of the words: should the API fail for any reason, add in the option to read them in locally from a text file which would prevent any negative user experience.

## Workload Planning

To break the project down, a live task board was utilised. Having this in place from the beginning has ensured that all the requirements from a development view have been captured. It has allowed me to successfully transition a task from "to do" right the way through to "done" whilst being able to keep track of any issues that presented a blocker and tackle them accordingly. A final view of the board can be seen below:

## Site Production, Deployment and Contribution  

### Site production

The site was created using Gitpod’s VS Code workspace environment with all the relevant files and folder structures created within. To deploy to GitHub, the following commands were carried out in the command line terminal to commit and push the changes to the GitHub repository: 

1 `git add .`- (Staging the changes in the current working tree ready to be committed).

2 `git commit -m 'Meaningful commit message"` - (The working tree is prepared with an upload message).

3 `git push` - (changes are pushed out up to the GitHub repository).

### Deployment

The site was deployed using Heroku. The steps to deploy are as follows:

1. login to Heroku.
2. Select "create new app" .
3. Create app .
4. Select "Settings" tab at the top.
5. Scroll down to "Buildpacks" and **add in the following order:**
    * `heroku/python`
    * `heroku/nodejs`
6. Scroll down to "Config Vars" and add the following:
    * `Key: PORT`
    * `value: 8000`

**Note:** If you have credentials, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.

7. Go to the "Deploy" tab at the top.
8. Select "GitHub" as the Deployment method.
9. Select "Connect to GitHub."
10. Search for your GitHub repository and click connect. Once connected, it will show as follows:

![Heroku/GitHub connection](readme-images/heroku-github.png)

11. Scroll down to "Manual deploy" and click "Deploy branch". The app will start to build installing the various packages listed and the dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file. Once complete, click on the "view" button which will take you to the live site:

![Successful deployment](readme-images/sucessful-deployment.png)

There is also the option to "Enable Automatic Deploys" which will build the app as soon as it is pushed to the GitHub repository and can be used if preferred.

The live link to the site can be found here: [Hangman Lite.](https://hangman-lite-2cf8212eb558.herokuapp.com/)


### Contribution

I welcome any contributions/recommendations/changes to the project. To do this, the GitHub repository would need to be forked from GitHub and downloaded locally so it can be worked on. 

GitHub has provided step by step instructions on how to do this [here.](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project#forking-a-repository)

      ```
          import gspread
          from google.oauth2.service_account import Credentials

          CREDS = Credentials.from_service_account_file('creds.json')
          SCOPED_CREDS = CREDS.with_scopes(SCOPE)
          GSPREAD_CLIENT = gspread.authorize(SCOPED_CREDS)
          SHEET = GSPREAD_CLIENT.open('hagman_lite_words')
          get_words = SHEET.worksheet('words')
      ```

## Overall Credit

A huge thank you to Code Institute for the learning and lesson material which has been amazing and my fellow students on Slack for their support! 
## Personal Summary

As this project was my first full exposure to indept python, it has brought with it a decent learning curve. The detailed content, and the invaluable advice and guidance from an amazing mentor has allowed me to further develop and refine on my coding journey.

I have endeavoured to implement any guidance given on my previous projects with the view of incorporating this as part of my standard coding practice.

The main take away point from this project has been around the value of breaking the requirements down into smaller manageable tasks on a "to do" list. Having this in place from the beginning has enabled me to build up the project step by step using a methodical approach. 

This has been taken on board with a view to maintaining this on future projects.
